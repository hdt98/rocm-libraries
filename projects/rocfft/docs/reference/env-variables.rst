rocFFT environment variables
********************************************************************

This section describes the most important rocFFT environment variables,
which are grouped by functionality.

Logging and debugging
=====================

The logging and debugging environment variables for rocFFT are collected in the
following table.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 70,30

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Value**

    * - | ``ROCFFT_LAYER``
        | Controls which logging layers are active using bitmask values.
      - | ``0``: No logging
        | ``1``: Trace logging
        | ``2``: Bench logging
        | ``4``: Profile logging

        | Values can be combined by adding multiple values together
        | E.g. ``ROCFFT_LAYER=12`` enables plan and profile logging (8 + 4 = 12)

    * - | ``ROCFFT_LOG_TRACE_PATH``
        | Specifies file path for trace logging output.
      - | String path to trace log file
        | Used when trace logging is enabled via ``ROCFFT_LAYER``

    * - | ``ROCFFT_LOG_BENCH_PATH``
        | Specifies file path for bench logging output.
      - | String path to bench log file
        | Used when bench logging is enabled via ``ROCFFT_LAYER``

    * - | ``ROCFFT_LOG_PROFILE_PATH``
        | Specifies file path for profile logging output.
      - | String path to profile log file
        | Used when profile logging is enabled via ``ROCFFT_LAYER``

    * - | ``ROCFFT_LOG_PLAN_PATH``
        | Specifies file path for plan logging output.
      - | String path to plan log file
        | Used when plan logging is enabled via ``ROCFFT_LAYER``

    * - | ``ROCFFT_LOG_KERNELIO_PATH``
        | Specifies file path for kernel I/O logging output.
      - | String path to kernel I/O log file
        | Used when kernel I/O logging is enabled via ``ROCFFT_LAYER``

    * - | ``ROCFFT_LOG_RTC_PATH``
        | Specifies file path for runtime compilation logging output.
      - | String path to RTC log file
        | Used when RTC logging is enabled via ``ROCFFT_LAYER``

    * - | ``ROCFFT_LOG_TUNING_PATH``
        | Specifies file path for tuning logging output.
      - | String path to tuning log file
        | Used when tuning logging is enabled via ``ROCFFT_LAYER``

    * - | ``ROCFFT_LOG_GRAPH_PATH``
        | Specifies file path for graph logging output.
      - | String path to graph log file
        | Used when graph logging is enabled via ``ROCFFT_LAYER``
        | Output can be used with ``graphviz``

    * - | ``ROCFFT_DEVICE_BW``
        | Specifies device memory bandwidth for performance calculations.
      - | Numeric value representing device bandwidth in GB/s
        | Used when computing numbers for profile logging (``ROCFFT_LAYER=4``)
