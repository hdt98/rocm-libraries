********************
hipDNN prerequisites
********************

Ensure your system has these requirements before installing hipDNN.

The hipDNN frontend API is distributed as a header-only library, requiring the development ROCm packages to be installed.
The base ROCm install package does *not* include the hipDNN frontend API header files.

These development packages contain the ``dev`` prefix. 
For example, on Linux with a gfx950 GPU, install the ``amdrocm-core-dev7.12-gfx950`` package instead of the ``amdrocm7.12-gfx950`` package (``amdrocm-core-dev7.12-gfx950`` includes the ``amdrocm7.121-gfx950`` package, so only the ``amdrocm-core-dev7.12-gfx950`` package needs to be installed).

System requirements
===================

- An AMD GPU with ROCm support (see `ROCm compatibility matrix <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/7.12.0/compatibility/compatibility-matrix.html>`_)
- Linux or Windows operating system (see `Install AMD ROCm <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/7.12.0/install/rocm.html>`_)
