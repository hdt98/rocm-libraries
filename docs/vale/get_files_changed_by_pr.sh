# A script to produce the list of files altered by a given PR, and optionally download them.
#     Should work on bash 3.2 and up.
#
# Accepts the following arguments:
#     -o String. The owner of the repository which the target PR is for.
#     -r String. The name of the repository which the target PR is for.
#     -p Integer. The PR number of the target PR.
#     -l Optional string. The full path to a local directory where the altered files should be downloaded. This
#                         directory, and parents, will be created if missing.
#                         If not present, no files will be downloaded; only the paths printed.
#     -d Optional string. Regex for the relative paths, such that only files whose relative paths match this regex
#                         will be downloaded. Only relevant if -l is set. Default: '^.*$'.
#     -t Optional string. The full path to a file that contains (only) the GitHub token that should
#                         be used to access GitHub. If not provided, the token will be requested via STDIN.
#
# Accepts over STDIN: The GitHub token, unless provided via the -t parameter.
#
# Outputs to STDOUT a list of file paths altered by the PR, in alphabetical order (according to current locale),
#     paths relative to repository root. For example:
#         projects/rocblas/library/src/blas/rocblas_tsrv_kernels.cpp
#         projects/rocblas/library/src/blaslt/rocblas_tsrq_kernels.cpp
# Outputs logs/debug messages to STDERR.
# Downloads the files changed in the PR into the -l directory, overwriting files if there is a name collision.
#     Only occurs if -l was provided.
#
# Returns code 0 on successfully concluding (after printing the paths and optionally downloading the files).
# Returns code 3 if the number of files altered in this PR exceeds 2500. This is done because the query to retrieve
#                the list of files altered is limited to 3000, and we give ourselves a margin of error.
#                The file paths that were acquired will not be printed in this case.
# Returns any other code in any other case.
