# Superbuild Limitations and Workarounds

## rocblas

### Fortran language support

When building rocblas with Fortran enabled (default), language violations relating to the use of `c_int` before `use iso_c_binding` is processed causes compilation errors when using `flang`:
```bash
/mnt/host/projects/rocblas/clients/samples/example_fortran_scal.f90:115:24: error: No explicit type declared for 'c_int'
                  result(c_int) &
                         ^^^^^
/mnt/host/projects/rocblas/clients/samples/example_fortran_scal.f90:117:17: error: Cannot use-associate 'c_int'; it is already declared in this scope
              use iso_c_binding
```

Although `flang` is included in the ROCm distributed binaries it strictly enforces this violation, whereas `gfortran` allows it.

**Option 1:** Force compilation with `gfortran`. This requires that `gfortran` is installed on the system.
```bash
cmake --preset rocblas -D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran
```

**Option 2:** Disable fortran.
```bash
cmake --preset rocblas -D ROCBLAS_ENABLE_FORTRAN=OFF
```

### Runtime code object lookup needs `ROCBLAS_TENSILE_LIBPATH`

Since rocblas clients conduct runtime lookup of tensile code objects, and the superbuild build-tree doesn't match the standalone build-tree, running rocblas clients requires `ROCBLAS_TENSILE_LIBPATH` to be set to point at the tensile library code objects.

**Example command** for running rocblas tests
```bash
export ROCBLAS_TENSILE_LIBPATH=$(pwd)/build/shared/tensile/Tensile/library
./build/projects/rocblas/clients/staging/rocblas-test --gtest_filter=*pre_checkin*
```
